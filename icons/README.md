# Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension details page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using any graphics editor. The recommended design should:

1. Be a microphone or speech-related symbol
2. Use a clean, modern design
3. Work well at small sizes (16x16)
4. Have a transparent background
5. Use colors that work in both light and dark themes

## Temporary Solution

For development, you can use simple colored squares or download free icons from:
- [Icons8](https://icons8.com/)
- [Flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/)
- [Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

The extension will work without custom icons (Chrome will use a default icon), but having proper icons improves the user experience.
